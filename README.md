FPS Target Practice Game
#NOTE  Map was removed due to the size and github limitations but the blueprints are intact.
This repository showcases a first-person shooter (FPS) target practice game developed entirely using Blueprints in Unreal Engine 5. The project was inspired by Unreal Sensei's How To Create An FPS Game in Unreal Engine 5 - Beginner Tutorial
, which provides a beginner-friendly approach to creating FPS mechanics in UE5.

Project Overview

The demo features:

First-Person Character: Implemented movement , physics and shooting mechanics.

Target Practice Range: Includes static targets for shooting practice with physics and destruction.

Scoring System: Tracks and displays scores based on target hits.

HUD Elements: Score , Time , End screen

Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I have gained:

Understanding of Unreal Engine's Blueprint system.

Experience in implementing FPS mechanics such as movement and shooting.

Knowledge of creating interactive targets and scoring systems.

Insights into designing and displaying HUD elements in UE5.
